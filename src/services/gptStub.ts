 * Improved deterministic GPT stub.
 * - Works when import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND === 'mock' or VITE_USE_MOCK === 'true'
 * - Pure, seeded PRNG so same prompt â†’ same output (good for tests)
 * - Exposes:
 *    - generateSynonyms(word, level)
 *    - rewriteSentence(input, opts)
 *    - suggestPhrasalVerbsForMeaning(meaning, level)
 *    - generateRewriteExerciseFromError(error)
